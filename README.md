# Bayesian parameter estimation for relativistic heavy-ion collisions

Workflow for a full Bayesian analysis in relativistic heavy-ion collisions: soft sector based on Jetscape
- The physical model simulation is based on [JETSCAPE framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07706). Regarding the `Installation`, `configuration`, running `JETSCAPE` and `analyze`, please check the official repository.
- This repository is devoted to **Bayesian analysis** of soft observables in heavy-ion collisions, where most of the statistical analysis work is inherited from [hic-param-est](http://qcd.phy.duke.edu/hic-param-est/). 
- There are four main stages to finish the analysis.
    - a. **design points** preparation
    - b. **model calculation** at each design point, done
