Input:
- Where the model calculations are
- How to read the model calculations
- Where the input parameters are

Function:
- Read model calculations
- Compute observables (including centrality selection)
- Principal component analysis (PCA) on the observables
- Build emulator on subset of PCA

Output:
- Save emulator so that observable calculations/PCA 
  doesn't have to be performed again
