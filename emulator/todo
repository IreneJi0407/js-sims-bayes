To-do

emulator.py:
*) How should model calculations be organized? This script (or some intermediary script) must know
*) How do we know what systems to train the emulators for??
*) How should the input parameters be passed?? Command line? Or by editing the top of the python script (the "input" section)?
*) How to read-in the design points? What format is expected?

model.py:
*) Yank out all functions that computes observables: these should be somewhere else
*) Decouple this scripts from the original "expt.py" scripts: 
  -> We need a way to specify which observables to train the emulator for that does not require experimental data
  -> How does the model.py script overlap with the "average_obs.py" script? We need to clarify that.
